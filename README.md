How well do you know me?

A CLI Quiz App to check how much you know about me. Hosted on repl.it

The app asks for the user's name and welcomes the user with a Hello Message. After that,
the app poses questions to the user to which the user has to respond by entering the exact answer.
The app lets the user know if the answer is right and shows the current score. After the quiz is 
completed, the app shows the final score of the user and also shows a high score tally, which is 
updated with the user's name if he/she has achieved a high score.
